# 0x17. Web stack debugging #3
In this project debugged why Apache was returning a 500 error, fixed the error and automated my fix.

**Concepts Used:**
- tmux: used to create an extra window block to monitor the implementation of the fix.
- strace: used to monitor system calls and signals to understand the foundation to the error.
- puppet manifest: to automate the fix.
